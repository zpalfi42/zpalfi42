<h1 align="center">Hi  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px">, welcome to my GitHub profile!</h1>

Who am I?ü§®. Well, I'm Zsolt (or zpalfi), i'm a 19yo boy from Rumania currently living in Barcelona. I love coding and face challenges that'll make my brain fire. Some years ago I started to study Electronic Engineering at UPC university, but after 1 year (in 2021) I decided to start studying in 42 Barcelona and I'm really glad of my decision.
